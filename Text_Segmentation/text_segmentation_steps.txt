 A) Hough Transform --> Rotate image to remove undesired skewness

2) get_lines()
""" A function that takes a binary image and returns the top and bottom Y coordinates of the rectangular sections,
    that do not contain characters, as well as a number of auxiliary parameters. """

 A) Obtain Y coordinates of lines (peaks) that are above a fine-tuned threshold
    (9% of peak of image's vertical projection)
 B) Obtain sections:
    - the starting and ending locations,
    - the max value,
    - and the height
     of each peak's neighborhood
 C) Combine sections that are too close together
    - Obtain distances between ALL sections (SEC_n+1_top - SEC_n_bottom)
    - From top to bottom, merge all sections that have too small distances between each other
 D) Adding buffer to sections if they are below average section height
 E) Remove sections with too small height (may occur due to very short lines with scattered artefacts)
 F) Obtain non-character containing sections,
    Create a bonus line at the top and bottom of the image based on average section height
